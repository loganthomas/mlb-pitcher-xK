# mlb-pitcher-xK

## Overview
`mlb-pitcher-xK` is a data science and machine learning project
focused on predicting MLB pitchers' strikeout percentages (`K%`)
for the 2024 season. Using historical pitching data, feature engineering,
and statistical modeling, this project aims to derive insights into
pitcher performance trends while emphasizing reproducibility
and employing best practices in data science.

## Problem Statement
The provided dataset in `data/k.csv` contains only eight columns:
1. `MLBAMID`: player's MLB ID
1. `PlayerId`: player's FanGraphs ID
1. `Name`: player's name
1. `Team`: player's team name (_NOTE_: `" - - -"` indicates the player played for multiple teams in a season)
1. `Age`: player's age in 2024 season
1. `Season`: season year
1. `TBF`: Total batters faced for the player-season
1. `K%`: Strikeout percentage for the player-season

**Objective**: Predict each playerâ€™s `K%` for the 2024 season using historical `K%` and other derived features.
The analysis excludes any data from Opening Day 2024 onward.

## Results
A linear regression model (`LinearRegression`) and two tree-based models (`XGBRegressor` and `RandomForestRegressor`) were developed using:
- Provided data (`k.csv`): historical `K%` and `TBF` values
- Supplemental data: Scraped statistics from [Baseball Reference Pitcher Data](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2024-pitches-pitching.shtml),
including advanced metrics like strike percentages and contact rates.

#### 2024 Predictions
|          model        |    R2  |    MSE   |
|:----------------------|:------:|:--------:|
| LinearRegression      | 0.945  | 0.00018  |
| XGBRegressor          | 0.935  | 0.00021  |
| RandomForestRegressor | 0.926  | 0.00024  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The LinearRegression model was chosen as the final model architecture.

### Key Features Used by the Model
- `I/Str`: ball in play percentage (balls put into play including hr / total strikes)
- `Pit/PA`: pitches per plate appearance
- `Con`: contact percentage ((foul + inplay strikes) / (inplay + foul + swinging strikes))
- `30%`: 3-0 count seen percentage (3-0 counts / PA)
- `L/SO`: strikeouts looking
- `F/Str`: foul ball strike percentage (pitches fouled off / total strikes seen)
- `Str%`: strike percentage (strikes / total pitches; intentional balls included)

| feature   |         coef |
|:----------|-------------:|
| I/Str     | -0.0528688   |
| Pit/PA    | -0.0143233   |
| Con       | -0.0124488   |
| 30%       | -0.00476233  |
| L/SO      |  0.00440924  |
| F/Str     | -0.00169988  |
| Str%      | -0.000350969 |

### Model Performance
The model effectively predicts `xK%` (expected strikeout percentage),
as demonstrated by the correlation between predicted and actual `K%`:

## Development Process
All analysis and modeling were conducted in Jupyter notebooks (see the [notebooks/](./notebooks) directory).
The final code was refactored into a Python package, `bullpen`, for modularity and reproducibility
(see [src/bullpen/](./src/bullpen/)). Key development steps include:
1. **Data Scraping**: Extracted supplemental data from Baseball Reference using `bullpen.data_utils`.
2. **Data Cleaning & Integration**: Processed and merged supplemental data with `k.csv`.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created data processing pipelines for scaling and one-hot encoding features using `bullpen.model_utils`.
4. Modeling: Trained and validated models using:
- Classic cross-validation (utilizing `sklearn.GridSearchCV`)
- Time-series cross-validation (implemented custom time splitting training loop)

## Scraping Supplementary Pitching Data from Baseball Reference

The provided dataset (`k.csv`) located in the `data/` directory contains essential but limited pitching statistics, with the following eight columns:

1. **`MLBAMID`**: Player's MLB ID
2. **`PlayerId`**: Player's FanGraphs ID
3. **`Name`**: Player's name
4. **`Team`**: Player's team name (*Note*: `" - - -"` indicates the player played for multiple teams in a season)
5. **`Age`**: Player's age during the 2024 season
6. **`Season`**: Year of the season
7. **`TBF`**: Total batters faced for the player-season
8. **`K%`**: Strikeout percentage for the player-season

To make accurate predictions of a pitcher's strikeout percentage (`K%`) for the 2024 season,
additional contextual data will likely be required. Fortunately, Baseball Reference offers a comprehensive dataset of MLB pitching statistics:
[Baseball Reference Pitching Data](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2021-pitches-pitching.shtml).

### Scraping Utility
To facilitate data collection, a scraping utility has been implemented:
- **`bullpen.data_utils.Scraper()`**: A core scraping tool for Baseball Reference data.
- **`bullpen.data_utils.batch_scrape()`**: A convenience function to scrape data across multiple seasons.

Since the dataset in `k.csv` covers the seasons from 2021 to 2024, we will limit our scraping to this same range.
